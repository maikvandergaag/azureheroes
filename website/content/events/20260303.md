Event-Driven DevOps: Automating Azure with Event Grid System Topics

Modern DevOps on Azure isn’t just about pipelines, it’s about making your platform reactive. With Event Grid system topics, you can automatically respond to changes in your Azure environment, triggering workflows the moment resources are created, updated, or deleted.

In this session, we’ll cover:
- How system topics work and how they fit into DevOps workflows
- Connecting Event Grid to various automation and orchestration tools
- Different practical use cases for event-driven automation
- A live demo where a resource change triggers a deployment-related automation

After this session, you’ll walk away with practical techniques to make your Azure platform more event-driven, reducing manual steps, closing feedback loops, and bringing DevOps automation to the next level.

🎤 Session 2 – Sagar Sharma / Steef Jan Wiggers
