Get ready for another exciting Azure Heroes Meetup! 🚀
Whether you’re a seasoned Azure professional or just starting your cloud journey, this is the perfect chance to connect with like-minded people, share knowledge, and be inspired by real-world Azure experiences.

**Speaker**: Sagar Sharma

Topic: Future of Azure Integration Services

Azure offers a wide range of tools for message, data, and event-based integrations and the journey so far has been impressive. But what does the future hold, especially with the rapid advances in AI?
Join us as Sagar Sharma takes us through what’s next for Azure Integration Services, with a special focus on the impact and opportunities presented by AI.

**Speaker** : Irwin Strachan

Topic: AI won’t replace you — but someone using AI will. Are you ready to be that someone?

The age of intelligent cloud operations is here — but are we ready? In this session, we’ll explore how AI is reshaping DevOps in Azure, challenge assumptions, and share real-world experiences from the field. Bring your stories, your successes, and your skepticism — the future isn’t just something we watch happen, it’s something we build together.
