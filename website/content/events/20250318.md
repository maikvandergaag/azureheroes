4. (Dev)Containers - It doesn't only work on my environment by Gert-Jan ter Shure
Across many fields within IT/Data/Software Engineering the phrase "But it worked on my machine" is often heard when deploying to environments or when onboarding new team members. Often the result of (long) forgotten (legacy) configuration on the workplace/environment which only pop-up when in greenfield scenario's.What if this wasn't needed? What if your development and runtime environments can be shared across all team members? Surely, this sounds like magic? It's not magic, it's (dev)containers.
