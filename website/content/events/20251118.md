**Speaker**: Soham Dasgupta

**Topic**: AI Developer Odyssey: Navigating Use Cases, Models, and Technical Patterns

In the ever-evolving world of AI, choosing the right language model and designing robust applications around it can be overwhelming.

**Speaker**: Mike Martin

**Topic**: 1,2,3… testing: is this thing on(line)? Meet your new Microsoft Testing tools.

Testing isn't just about finding bugs — it's about ensuring reliability, performance, and resilience in your apps.
