# Azure Heroes Community Group

Welcome to the Azure Heroes repository! This repository is dedicated to the **Azure Heroes** community group, a collective of passionate individuals focused on sharing knowledge, organizing events, and supporting the Azure ecosystem.

## Website

The main content of this repository is the community website, which is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. The website includes:
- Event information
- Team details
- Sponsor highlights
- Community resources
- Contact and subscription forms

You can find the website source in the `website/` directory.

## Getting Started

To build or run the website locally, make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed, then run:

```pwsh
hugo server
```

This will start a local development server. For production builds, use:

```pwsh
hugo build
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or reach out via the contact form on the website.
